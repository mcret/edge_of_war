[[The New Rose]] is intact, wedged between undersea mountains. It's lights are on, which is weird.

[[The Deep Diver]] gets caught in a current that slams it against [[The New Rose]], flooding, and the group gets out and swims over to [[The New Rose]]. No one is there, but there is a disembodied set of voices whispering 
> "slipping through streams slipping slipping slipping through the streams"

[[Ahren]] paints a 2 foot red circle in the first room we see.

We move to a dining room, I take a bottle of wine and paint a blue circle on the door.

[[Kirk]] has a bottle of wine as well.

The next room is a library

I saw something out the corner of my eye run past back to the dining room. Nothing was there.


Next room is the radio room. There is an aarakocra child(?) named [[Qahri]] that is surprised we are there and that we are real. And "doesn't want to think" about how we got here.

[[Qahri]] sings what we had been hearing whispering as a sea shanty.
[[Henri]] accidentally breaks the radio transmitter while convincing [[Qahri]] we can help

I knock out [[Qahri]] (they were pointing a gun at us) and [[Henri]] is able to fix the radio and transmit. After a decent pause, [[Buij]] responds.

[[Buij]] suggests that the only way they could assist in dislodging the balloon is with torpedos.

We asked [[Buij]] to _not_ shoot torpedos at [[The New Rose]].
