[[Henri]], [[Jack]], [[Kirk]], and [[Ahren]]

Yesterday, 345 people on [[The New Rose]] went missing over a large body of water on the border between [[Askyya]] and [[Nerovgard]]. We begin on [[The Horizon Conqueror]] (a sea-faring battleship). The mission is to find [[The New Rose]], as a peace-keeping mission.

The group was taken to the bridge, and Ahren tagged Kirk's back in pink.

The captain(?) [[Capt Diasma]] welcomes us by telling us that we aren't really supposed to be here as this is a "working ship".

The group introduces itself, starting with Henri, who also introduces his submersible "[[The Deep Diver]]".
Kirk is with a safety board from some third party country
Jack is from [[Stevostan]]

First mate's name is [[Henri Withawhy]]
Quartermaster is [[Buij]]

* The captain takes us over to a computer where a readout shows: at 2243, [[The New Rose]] fell off of radar.
* No record of anything happening to indicate attack, etc.
* Some anomalies prior to that point, likely data fuzziness.
	* Audio anomalies
* No emergency signal, nothing, it is just gone.

Ship was traveling at 35 knots, the "standard" airship speed.
The surface has been scanned pretty extensively.
[[The New Rose]] is a balloon-style airship, painted with high visibility safety pain.

The audio is played for the group, possibly has some morse code over a live broadcast.

Henri recognizes the first portion of the message spells out "help"
Kirk recognizes "sea"

The captain says that [[Nerovgard]] can blur the ships readings

We are shown altitude and radar data. Altitude and speed are correct. "The usual" amount of "normal air traffic" is present. There were 4 other airships within 10 nautical miles. Kirk gets the data on them
* 2 from [[Askyya]]
* 1 from [[Stevostan]]
* 1 from [[Nerovgard]]
None report any anomalies

We are given pictures of [[The New Rose]] and escorted from the bridge to the submersible [[The Deep Diver]].
We get in, and Kirk confronts Ahren about getting tagged
Jack gets knocked over as the sub sways as it is lowered. Ahren helps him get up, and attempts to tag him as he helps him up.

The "windows" on the sub use illusion magic to show what is outside, including under low light.
Minimum viable "go down and don't break" build.
There is a radio.

Blimps are a thing in the world, but no planes.
Airships are civilian vessels
