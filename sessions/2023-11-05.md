[[Qahri]] had mentioned that we were not the first to have appeared. He (based on plumage) fought back.

[[Janneke]] has indicated that if the balloon was dislodged, it would float.

There are supposed to be enough life ships to accommodate everyone on board, there is only one left. All the one's not present, if there _were_ launched, it was hurried. At least on may have been violently ripped off.

The red "wood" sheds [[Ahren]]'s paint, and he gets everyone's attention. [[Ahren]] tries to scratch the floor, it does not scratch, then he tries the wall, it also does not scratch. [[Jack]] strikes the wall with his sword, and the ship resounds with an echoing, reverberating groan.

The life boat does not appear to have this property, but it is fundamentally unsound, and the controls are not at their default states.

[[Henri]] with a nat 20, heard a dragging sound. [[Ahren]] hid between Kirk and Jack. [[Kirk]] lights his sword with lightening, which causes some of the red to receded and chars the wood underneath. There is some illusion magic present, but it is not the red stuff covering the walls and floors. It is weird and powerful.

We hear an adult woman's malicious laughter echoing through the hall, coming from the spot [[Henri]] pointed out. The red quivers, empowered by the laughter.

[[Ahren]] Leeroy-Jenkins down the hall and makes a small contact
The lightening sword causes a woman to fade into view. A [Lamia](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16941-lamia).

The lamia, [[Nixenya]], has claimed the ship as her own, and says there is no leaving. [[Ahren]] attacks her again.

Initiative is called
1. round 1
	1. [[Ahren]] tags her back and disengages.
	2. [[Kirk]] attacks with the lightening sword.
	3. [[Jack]] asks her to leave the ship peacefully
	4. [[Kirk]] tries to negotiate and put his sword away, but stabs the wall by accident, setting it on fire, and causing it to scream
	5. [[Nixenya]] attacks us all, and only hits [[Henri]]
		1. she vanishes

[[Jack]] put out the fire with a nat 20
[[Kirk]] notices that the floor is vibrating, with increasing intensity.

The group heads back to the radio room, [[Qahri]] is still unconscious, the vibrating stops.

[[Kirk]] noticed that the vibrations have stopped, but the hallway that was red, now looks like a normal hallway.

[[Henri]] tries to use the radio, but only hears static. [[Jack]] and [[Kirk]] hear [[The Horizon Conqueror]].

[[Buij]] is brought up to speed, but very confused, and thinks we are seeing things due to "stress". [[Ahren]] interrupts a few times.

Lamias are native to myths in [[Nerovgard]]. It may have been onboard when the ship departed
